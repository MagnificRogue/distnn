====================

##Distributive Neural Networks (distnn)


This luarocks package is used to automatically scale the training of convolution neural networks across multiple MPI nodes.

This package plans on supporting the following features in order of intended implementation:

1) Automatic data parallelism
2) Automatic model parallelism
